# Intro

- Segment Tree is a basically a binary tree used for storing the intervals or segments. Each node in the Segment Tree represents an interval. Consider an array `A` of size `N` and a corresponding Segment Tree `T`:
    - The root of `T` will represent the whole array `A[0: N - 1]`
    - Each leaf in the Segment Tree `T`  will represent a single element `A[i]` such that.
