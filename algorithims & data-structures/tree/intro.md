# Full Binary Tree
- A Binary Tree is a full binary tree if every node has `0 or 2 children`. The following are the examples of a full binary tree. We can also say a full binary tree is a binary tree in which all nodes except leaf nodes have two children. 
```
         18
    15        30  
40      50  100  40

            18
        15      20
    40      50
30      50

        18
    40      30
        100     40
```

# Complete Binary Tree
- A Binary Tree is a Complete Binary Tree if all the levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible 

```

            18
        15        30
    40      50  100 40

                18
        15            30
    40       50      100   40
8       6   9
```

# Perfect Binary Tree
- A Binary tree is a Perfect Binary Tree in which all the internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
