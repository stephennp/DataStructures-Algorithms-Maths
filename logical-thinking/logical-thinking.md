# Intro

- Logical interview questions involve solving brainteasers or some type of riddle to show the interviewer your critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills and analytical skills.
- Logic questions for interview purposes can be used to assess these skillsets as well as gauge the way you ask for information, use resources and work under pressure.

# Three light bulbs

- In this logic question, you are standing in a room with three light switches. The switches all correspond to three different light bulbs in an adjacent room that you cannot see into. With all the light switches starting in the off position, how can you find out which switch connects to which light bulb?

- Answer: "I would turn on the first switch and let it stay on for a few minutes. Then, I'd turn the first switch off and quickly turn on the second switch. Then, checking the room, I'd see the second bulb turned on and feel the other two bulbs to see which one is warmer. The warmer bulb is the one I just turned off, so that belongs to the first switch, while the bulb that's on belongs to the second switch. The third switch would belong to the bulb that is off and coolest to the touch."

# Manhole covers

- This logical question can be presented as a riddle, and there are several variations on the format of this puzzle. Here is the question:

- Why are manhole covers round?

- Example answer: "Manhole covers are round so they never need to be rotated to place the cover back on. Also, circles are the only geometric shape that won't fall in on itself in a similarly-shaped hole, so it should never be able to fall in. For instance, a square manhole cover might fall in a square hole if it were inserted diagonally."

# The farmer, the fox and the chicken

- In this riddle, you are presented with the farmer's problem of transporting his animals and crops across a river. Here is the question:

- A farmer needs to cross the river with his fox, his chicken and a bag of corn. However, the boat can only fit the farmer and one other thing at a time. The problem is, the fox and the chicken are both hungry, so if he leaves the fox and chicken together, the fox might eat the chicken. If he leaves the chicken and corn together, the chicken might eat the corn.

- So how can the farmer get everyone across the river safely?

- Example answer: "First, the farmer should take the chicken across. Then, he can go back for the fox. When he arrives at the other side to drop off the fox, he can take the chicken back with him to get the corn. The farmer drops off the chicken and transports the corn to the other side of the river. Finally, the farmer goes back for the chicken and continues to the other side of the river with nothing eaten."

# Four names

- This question is a fairly simple riddle and it really only depends on your active listening skills. Here is the question:

- Jane's mother has four children. The first child's name is Spring, the second child's name is Summer and the third child's name is Autumn. What is the fourth child's name?

- Example answer: "The fourth child's name is Jane because she was named at the very beginning."

# Rolling the dice

- This numeracy puzzle can take a variety of forms, however, the basis is typically the same:

- If I roll two dice, what is the probability that I will get a two on the second roll?

- Example answer: "I would calculate the simple probability of rolling a two in the first place. That results in a 1/6 chance of rolling a two. The probability of rolling a two on the second roll will also be a 1/6 chance. Multiply these two probabilities together and the result is a 1/12 chance that you will roll a two on your second try."

# Filling the jugs

- This question can require some mathematical computation:

- If you have a three-gallon jug and a five-gallon jug, how can you measure out exactly four gallons of water?

- Example answer: "First, I would fill the three-gallon jug and pour it into the five-gallon jug. Next, I'd fill the three-gallon jug again, and fill the five-gallon jug all the way up to capacity. Since the five-gallon jug is already holding three gallons in it, the three-gallon jug will have one gallon of water remaining in it. Then, I'd empty the full five-gallon jug and pour the one gallon of water I saved into it. Finally, I'd fill the three-gallon jug and add it to the gallon of water in the five-gallon jug, resulting in a total of four gallons."

# Forecasting rain

- This logical interview question may also rely on some basic probability calculations:

- Let's say you are traveling to Washington D.C. to visit some friends. You call three of your friends to see if it is raining in the city. What is the probability that it is actually raining in Washington D.C.?

- Example answer: "Since I only need one friend to tell me the truth for it to be raining, it could be easier to calculate the probability that all three friends are lying. So I can calculate that each person has a 1/3 chance of lying about the rain. Multiplied together I get 1/27 chances that all three friends lied about the weather. That means that there are 26/27 chances that it is actually raining. This equals a 96% chance of it raining when I arrive to the city."

# Ping pong balls on a plane

- This question might rely on some factual information, however, some interviewers may be more concerned with how you process the information, use resources and create a solution. Additionally, with questions like this, you might consider asking for more information to help you with your calculations. Here is the question:

- How many ping pong balls can you fit into a Boeing 747?

- Example answer: "First, I need to know the volume of a ping pong ball, as well as the volume inside a Boeing 747. Knowing this information, I can then divide the volume of the plane by the volume of one ping pong ball. This will result in an approximate amount of ping pong balls that would fit inside the plane."

# Climbing a wall

- This numeracy question focuses on number patterns and how you process information to calculate an outcome. Here is the question:

- Imagine you are standing at the bottom of a 30-foot wall. You start climbing, and each hour you climb three feet but slide down two feet. Assuming you keep this pattern of climbing, how long will it take you to climb to the top of the wall?

- Example answer: "First, to find the total amount I've climbed in an hour, I take away two feet per hour that I slip. This gives me a total of one foot per hour of climbing, which results in 27 hours. Assuming I don't fall the next hour, that's three more feet to reach the top at 30 feet high. However, for every three feet I gain, I do fall, so subtracting two feet for slipping during the last hour results in a total of 28 hours spent climbing."

# Stacking pennies

- In this amount of puzzle, the interviewer may be more concerned with your problem-solving skills than the answer you arrive at. Still, you can use basic mathematical calculations and information from your interviewer to answer this question:

- How many pennies, if they are stacked on top of each other, will it take to reach the top of the Empire State Building?

- Example answer: "First, I need to know how tall the Empire State Building is, as well as how tall a penny is when it's laying flat. Assuming one penny is a 1/4 inch high, I can divide the height of the building by the height of the penny to get the number of pennies I'll need to stack."
