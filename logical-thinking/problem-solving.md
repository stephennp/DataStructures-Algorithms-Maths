# Delivery vs quantity
- Delivery
  -  a deadline and that no one will give you the time needed to write the quality code you’d like to produce.
  - It is also obvious that no one will accept a buggy code that will crash on production.
  - buggy behavior exhibited by the code
  - slow implementation to production
  - messy code with low cohesion and high coupling
  -  code that cannot be maintained
   - usage of obsolete libraries/frameworks
   - repetition of code leading toward costly refactoring

- Quantity
  - have thousands of log entries emitted from your system each second, and once you encounter a problem you browse through these logs in order to figure out what went wrong
  - writing quality logs when you can actually understand the story of what your system does from your log records alone
  - severity, category, class name, method name,
  - maintainable
  - Follows a consistent design style
  - Remains easy to understand
  - Requirements have been well documented
  - Is highly testable via automation
  - Is easier to comprehend and to follow along (eg, is highly maintainable)
  - Portability: As its namesake tells us, this is the measurement of how well the software will perform in a variety of environments. It basically ascribes to platform independency.

# How do you handle stress?
I’m able to stay calm when I focus on the bigger picture and break down my projects into smaller tasks.
 I always start by asking myself, “What is the ultimate goal I’m trying to achieve?” From there, I make a list of immediate and long-term action items with achievable but ambitious deadlines.
 Even if the big project is due tomorrow, I ask myself, ‘What’s something I can tackle in the next 30 minutes?’ Before I know it, I’ve made significant progress and that impossible project doesn’t seem so impossible.”

# What is your greatest accomplishment?

# How do you handle conflict at work?
I was working as a project manager on an IT project, and one technician was constantly late finishing tasks. When I approached him about it, he reacted defensively. I kept calm and acknowledged that the deadlines were challenging and asked how I could assist him in improving his performance.

He calmed down and told me that he was involved in another project where he had to do tasks that were not in his job description. After a meeting with the other project manager, we came to a resolution that alleviated the technician’s workload. For the remainder of the project, the technician delivered great work.
# Question 1: Describe a situation where you had to solve a problem. What did you do? what was the result? What might you have done differently?
This question tests their problem-solving ability. As an employer, you want to hire people that get things done and when faced with a problem actively solve it. There are three steps to solving a problem:

    Identify
    Analyse
    Implement
    
A good answer should show that the applicant took the initiative, didn’t act thoughtlessly and was willing to ask questions and work as a team. Ideally their actions were in that order.



# Question 2: Give an example of a situation in which you saw an opportunity in a potential problem. What did you do? What was the outcome?
This question tests if they see opportunities in problems. Every business has problems, both minor and major, and you should be able to trust your employees to identify and solve them. Problems are opportunities for improvement, both for an individual and a company as a whole.

Essentially you are looking for an answer that recognises this. Whether they solved a problem single-handedly or flagged the issue to a superior, you are looking for applicants who played a key part in arriving at a solution.

# Question 3: What steps do you take before making a decision on how to solve a problem, and why?
This question tests how they problem solve before making a decision. A strong answer showcases that the candidate is considered in their decision-making and has a formal process of thought, instead of becoming overwhelmed and acting rashly. You should be looking for those that have a formalised process that makes sense, and that shows that they don’t just ask for help the entire time.



# Question 4: Give an example of a time that you realised a colleague had made a mistake. How did you deal with this? What was the outcome?
This question tests their interpersonal skills. The best type of employees have great interpersonal skills and help others to succeed. Therefore, a good answer should show the candidate was diplomatic and constructive – someone that helps their colleagues to solve problems and doesn’t just highlight them.

Anyone that proceeds to say unsavoury things about previous co-workers should be treated with caution – respect and kindness are core attributes in the workplace.

This question tests their problem-solving strategies. An impressive answer will showcase awareness of problem-solving strategies, although these may differ from person to person.

You don’t want to hire someone that is constantly asking for help and knowing that a candidate has given some thought to potential strategies will provide you with assurance. Problem-solving strategies could vary from data-driven or logical methods to collaboration or delegation.

Question 6: Describe the biggest work-related problem you have faced. How did you deal with it?
This question tests how they tackle big problems. It reveals three things about a candidate:

1. What they are willing to share about a previous employer.

2. What they consider to be a big problem.

3. How they problem solve.

You want a candidate to be appropriate when discussing their current (or former role) and be positive. Of course what constitutes a big problem is relative, but you should be wary of candidates that sound like they might become overwhelmed by stress or blow things out of proportion.

# Question 7: Tell me about a time where you have been caught off-guard by a problem that you had not foreseen? What happened?
This question tests how they deal with pressure. Even the most careful minds can crash into an unforeseen iceberg, but it is how they deal with it that matters. This question should be a chance for you to catch a glimpse of a candidate’s character and personality. Ideally, you want an answer that shows the following:

Calmness – They don’t overreact
Positivity – They don’t complain or blame others
Solutions – They use problem-solving skills
Question 8: Describe a time where you developed a different problem-solving approach. What steps did you follow?
This question tests their creative problem-solving skills and initiative. If your company was complete you wouldn’t be hiring. Someone that takes initiative and thinks outside of the box can help your business progress and stay ahead of the competition. Creative initiative is a definite bonus as you don’t want an office filled with like-minded people, after all, it’s the new ideas that change the world.



# Question 9: Tell me about a time when you became aware of a potential problem and resolved it before it became an issue.
This question tests their ability to identify problems and solve them. Having foresight is important quality and it’s much more than wearing glasses. Foresight is about identifying issues before they actually become issues. Being able to see into the future and red-flagging a problem, is something that you should not only value, but covet – being thoughtful helps avoid disaster.
