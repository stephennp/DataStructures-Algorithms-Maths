# Intro
- A graph is a data structure that is defined by two components :
  - A `node` or a vertex.
  - An `edge` E or ordered pair is a connection between two nodes u,v that is identified by unique pair(u,v). The pair (u,v) is ordered because (u,v) is not same as (v,u) in case of directed graph.The edge may have a weight or is set to one in case of unweighted graph.
 - Graphs are used to represent many real-life applications:
  - Graphs are used to represent networks. The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network.
  - Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook. For example, in Facebook, each person is represented with a vertex(or node). Each node is a structure and contains information like person id, name, gender, and locale.
