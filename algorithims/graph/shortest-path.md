# Intro
- Shortest path algorithms are widely used in transportation and scheduling
- Such algorithms focus on the most efficient route between a pair of nodes
- Edge weights determine the cost of a path in such algorithms
- If all edge weights are equal, use the unweighted shortest path algorithm
- If edge weights are unequal, use Dijkstraâ€™s algorith
