# Intro
- Shortest path algorithms are widely used in transportation and scheduling
- Such algorithms focus on the most efficient route between a pair of nodes
- Edge weights determine the cost of a path in such algorithms
- If all edge weights are equal, use the unweighted shortest path algorithm
- If edge weights are unequal, use Dijkstra’s algorith

# Applications
- Getting from Point A to Point B
  - Route through less congested roads
  - Multiple deliveries to multiple locations
  - Costly to ford rivers, pass mountains

# Unweighted Graphs
- All edges have equal weights
- Shortest path has smallest number of hops
- Unweighted shortest path algorithm
# Weighted graphs
- Edges have differing weights
- Shortest path has lowest sum of weights along path
- Djisktra’s algorithm
